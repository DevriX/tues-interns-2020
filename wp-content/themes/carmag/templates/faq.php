                            There is no universal warranty for each car on the site, 
                            it depends on the person from whom you buy and the same applies to additional services and arrangements, it is individual for each.
                            However, CarMag works with trusted car dealers and we will do our best to make your purchase safe and hassle-free.

                            You can negotiate, but you can’t use the same process for buying a new car buying. 
                            This is because every used car is slightly different. 
                            My new car buying strategy is based upon getting prices for the exact same make, model, trim car from different sellers.

                            You are highly unlikely to find a car dealer that will allow you to put the whole cost of a car on a credit card. 
                            However, you often can use a credit card for your down payment and earn points.

                        <div class="field-content">
                            Yes, unfortunately. It seems silly, but some dealers will charge more for certain colors. 
                            Make sure you ask that any additional charges (like paint) are included in the price they give you.

                        <div class="field-content">
                            Dealer holdback is a refund to the dealer from the manufacturer, typically 2-3% of MSRP. 
                            It’s usually not negotiable and best to be ignored by car buyers.

                        <div class="field-content">
                            Absolutely! If you need to buy two cars and want to get the same make (example, Honda), 
                            this will help you get an even better deal. When you email car dealers, explain you want a price for both cars. 
                            Be specific with the make, model, and trim for each car and be consistent in your emails to every dealer.

                            Before going to the dealership, get an appraisal for your car so you know how much it’s worth. 
                            Understand how much you can get and remember the tax implications.
