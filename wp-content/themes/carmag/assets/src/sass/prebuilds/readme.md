**None of the styles here are included by default in the theme**

This prebuild folder is made so you can grab styling snippets from here and use them right on the theme you are building. It's purpose is to give you styled elements in contrast to the barebone structure of the starter theme.

----

Copy-paste snippets of Sass code or the whole file. We will try to provide as many variables as possible here so you can modify it as easy as possible and setup your own color scheme, fonts etc. 

At the top of the file there will be all variables required for this specific file which will be using only the default ones set in the base/_settings.scss file
