						<h4 class="title">Initial Setup Time</h4>
						<div class="content">
							<p>In order to get the local team up to speed, we usually need 4 to 6 hours for setting up a project in our local environments and doing the initial review. This could be handled as an initial fee or as a part of the first month or two for your maintenance.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-element">
						<h4 class="title">Upfront Payment</h4>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Maintenance payments are to be processed prior to starting our initial setup and at the beginning of every month or quarter. We dedicate our technical resources only upon paid invoices.</p>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="faq-element">
						<h4 class="title">Billable Hours Transfer</h4>
						<div class="content">
							<p>If you don't use all of your available hours for the month, they will be transferred to the next one. There is a maximum limit of 60 hours that could be transferred with time. All hours are lost if the contract is terminated (i.e. the recurring payment is not processed).</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-element">
						<h4 class="title">Additional Work</h4>
						<div class="content">
							<p>If you need assistance with technical requests that would take longer than your available hours, you can submit a ticket and ask for an estimate.</p>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="faq-element">
						<h4 class="title">Communication and PM</h4>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Your time is valuable and we appreciate that - but so is ours. We charge about our time and work and should you require calls or extensive communication, this would be billed as part of your maintenance hours. Choose wisely and plan effectively and we'll take it from there.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-element">
						<h4 class="title">Shared Hosting</h4>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Shared hosting plans are cheap and easy to manage, but they are also quite limited. We suggest VPS-driven or cloud based solutions with ssh access so that we could run our tools without hitting any limitations. This helps us perform better, faster and take a better care of your website.</p>
